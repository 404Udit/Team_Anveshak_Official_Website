By adopting CAN communication, Isaac achieves reliable and efficient data exchange between its various subsystems, ensuring synchronized operation and real-time control. The use of custom motor drivers further optimizes the performance of its motors, providing precise control over speed and torque while enhancing energy efficiency. Coupled with its steering capability, Isaac can navigate challenging terrain with improved maneuverability and adaptability."

This advancement allows the rover to maneuver with far greater precision and flexibility compared to previous models with fixed wheels. By integrating an active steering system, Heisenberg can adjust the angle of its wheels to navigate complex and unpredictable terrain more effectively, reducing the risk of getting stuck or damaging its wheels."

From complex manipulation tasks, such as operating its robotic arm to collect samples or interact with scientific instruments, to advanced navigation across challenging terrain, the rover relies entirely on its sophisticated onboard systems. Its autonomy allows it to analyze its surroundings, plan safe and efficient paths, avoid obstacles, and perform scientific experiments independently."

            desc: "Galileo comes as an enhanced iteration of our preceding 6-wheeled rovers, specifically designed to address the prevalent camber-related challenges encountered during traversal. Moreover, we have substantially augmented the ground clearance to facilitate superior navigation across obstacles. In pursuit of an expanded work-envelope, we have transitioned from linear actuators to worm gears for the precise manipulation of the shoulder and elbow joints, enabling a heightened range of motion. The implementation of worm gear technology has facilitated the utilization of friction gripping in the rover's gripper system. This advanced gripping mechanism employs 3D printed flexible fingers composed of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), ensuring enhanced dexterity and adaptability. Furthermore, the wire management within the rover has been significantly enhanced through the integration of newly developed easily detachable modular connectors, optimizing efficiency and facilitating streamlined maintenance."

We placed an emphasis on modularity and stability. The rover has a wider base area and an arm with a larger workspace. The electronics are also modularized, allowing for faster debugging and reliability. In addition, the system architecture was optimized and faster algorithms were implemented in order to improve performance."

The new, lightweight manipulator holds an end effector with adaptive fingers, capable of wrapping around objects of all shapes and sizes. The state of the art electronic system makes sure that the rover is able to operate seamlessly and reliably. The new software core improves the autonomous capabilities and the ease of controlling the rover."

            desc: "New rover design shifted to a 4 wheel design that saw the implementation of a steering mechanism and a bar differential to stabilize the chassis box. The manipulator was designed to be modular and the gripper was completely fastener free. We reached the 25th position in URC 2018, a steady improvement from URC 2017, while our innovative designs were highly appreciated by other teams & judges. From qualifying to participate in the European Rover Challenge(ERC) 2016 to actually finishing in the top 25 positions in University Rover Challenge(URC) 2018, we as a team have grown at a rapid pace & have learned & improved at each stage."

With custom manufactured aluminium wheels, this rover could easily navigate moderately hard to rocky terrain with ease. The manipulator was mounted on 2 separate points on the chassis to improve the stability of the rover and provide better weight distribution. In our debut attempt, we qualified for URC 2017, eventually finishing 29th out of 70+ teams from across the world."
